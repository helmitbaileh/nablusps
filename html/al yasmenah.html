        <p>
            Harat Al-Yasmeena, also known as Hay Al-Yasmeena, is one of the neighborhoods located in the old city of Nablus in
            the West Bank. It occupies the southwestern corner of the old city and is home to Al-Khidra Mosque. The neighborhood
            showcases numerous examples of ancient architectural art in the form of houses that were built hundreds of years ago.
            One of its proudest buildings is the Palace of Abd Al-Hadi, situated at the heart of Harat Al-Yasmeena near Al-Satoun
            Mosque.

            The neighborhood also features several soap factories and historical mosques, such as Al-Khidra Mosque, Al-Satoun
            Mosque, Al-Hanbali Mosque, Al-Bayyak Mosque, and the Turkish Bath, Hammam Al-Sumara.

            In the past, Harat Al-Yasmeena was inhabited by a small Samaritan minority in an area called Harat Al-Sumara, before
            most of them relocated to the top of Mount Gerizim.
