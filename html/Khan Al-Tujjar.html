        <h1>Khan Al-Tujjar</h1>
        <p>
            Khan Al-Tujjar, also known as the Merchants' Khan, is located in the heart of the old city of Nablus and serves as
            its primary commercial center. It was built in the 10th Hijri century / 16th century AD by the Turkish minister Lala
            Mustafa Pasha, inspired by the famous Al-Hamidiyah Souq in Damascus. The Khan was later restored and renovated in the
            year 1102 Hijri / 1690 AD.

            The inner Khan was restored in 1355 Hijri / 1927 AD after an earthquake, and it was further renovated in 1987. The
            eastern entrance of the Khan, including the bridge and the residential buildings above it, suffered destruction
            during the Israeli invasion in 2002.
