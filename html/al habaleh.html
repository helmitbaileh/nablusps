            Bab Al-Saha is a bustling commercial area located in the center of the Qasbah neighborhood within the old city of
            Nablus. It derives its name from the presence of a main square surrounded by gates leading to the neighborhoods of
            Al-Qaryoun, Al-Aqaba, and Al-Habalat. At the heart of the square stands an ancient clock tower dating back to the
            Ottoman era, situated in front of the historic Al-Nasr Mosque. On the southern side of the square, one can find
            the remains of the former Turkish government headquarters.

            Today, this area serves as the main market for used goods and furnishings in Nablus.
